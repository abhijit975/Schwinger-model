## Schwinger-model
Variational quantum algorithm to find the ground state of Schwinger model (a U(1) lattice gauge theory) using two different ansatzes and comparison with exact diagonalization. The theory is based on: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08653.pdf 

The two ansatzes are taken from the papers: 
1. Resource Hamiltonian -- https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03421.pdf
2. MBVQE -- https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13940.pdf
